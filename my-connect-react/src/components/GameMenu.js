    "This app includes 4 AI levels, including a Minimax-based 'Impossible' mode.",
    "Always look for diagonal threats â€” many players miss them until it's too late!",
    "The longest possible game (without a win) has 42 moves â€” the board completely full.",
    "The 'Impossible' AI uses alpha-beta pruning to reduce search time while still playing optimally.",
    "The Hard AI uses a simplified version of Minimax â€” tough, but beatable!",
    "The Easy AI is great for beginners â€” it plays random valid moves.",
    "Originally this was my first project using react, a very basic project, now it's a full-featured game Iâ€™m proud of!",
    "All AI logic is written from scratch â€” no libraries used for decision-making.",
    "The confetti effect was added using the 'react-confetti' package â€” just for the win!",
    "Each game mode (Human vs. Human, vs. AI) is dynamically loaded and animated.",
    "Adding difficulty-based AI was a great way to learn the Minimax algorithm!",
    "A key development challenge was optimizing AI speed without sacrificing intelligence.",
    "The board highlights the last AI move â€” a small UX detail that improves playability.",
    "Connect 4 is a great intro to game theory, algorithms, and front-end design.",
    "Poppins font and animated tokens were added to give this project a polished, fun feel!",
    "Yes, I lost to my own AI. Yes, Iâ€™m okay with it. (No, Iâ€™m not).",
